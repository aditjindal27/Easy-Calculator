# About
In India there are various units of local land measurement (like “bigha and marla” ) in use, and often people get confused among them. I started learning more about these units by visiting local farms and villages. Interestingly, I found out that the same units had different meanings in different places. This information was not available on the Internet. I then decided to make a mobile app called - ‘Easy Calculator’ which could interconvert these units. Using a ruler, I used to make a standard one-square-meter area wherever I went. Then by interacting with people, I noted the area in their units and wrote the conversions.
